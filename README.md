# Taskgraph Discussion

We have a number of ideas, questions, points of confusion, etc. about Gecko- and standalone- taskgraph. We haven't formalized many of the standard workflows or processes. Let's:

- add a single markdown file per discussion point
- discuss in PRs and markdown
- if and when it makes sense, let's formalize via releng-rfcs.
